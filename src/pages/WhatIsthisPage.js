               Have you ever stumbled across something you wanted to remember but forgot it the same evening? This page was created to remember all the stuff that you see, hear or read at
               any places from any sources to keep it available forever and ever. Found an interesting news article because there was this one super convincing argument you find really important
               for your next discussion with your conservative voting grandpa? Finally found that one video that properly explains how CSS actually works? Found a fun fact you really really
               need to tell at the next party? Found the best Star Wars meme you've ever seen? Save it here and remember it forever!
            </p>
